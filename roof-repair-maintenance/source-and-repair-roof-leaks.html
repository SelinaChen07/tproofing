Great detective work is needed to fix mysterious roof leaks. Trent Faulkner, owner of TP Roofing personally carries out every initial inspection to determine the cause of your roof leakage. Trent will firstly inspect the roof leak, water stains and mould on your ceilings internally, he will then access the roof externally to trace the cause of moisture penetration and water entry. Water travels, the point of water entry can be several meters away from where the roof leak is. TP Roofing’s quotes clearly outline what needs to be done to fix your roof at a specified price.</p>

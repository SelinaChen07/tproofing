TP Roofing can assess and advise on roof damage for your tile, metal, slate, polycarbonate or shingle roof following a storm. We assess how extensive, severe or minor the damage to your roof is offering free quotes on emergency roof repairs. We will carry out a thorough inspection firstly internally of your ceilings and then externally to determine the best course of action to ensure your home is protected from the elements.</p>
<p> High winds and rain, hail, falling trees and branches can all cause damage to your roof, opening holes, making your home vulnerable to water entry. Water damage can be very costly, paint work can bubble, carpets and furnishings ruined, ceilings can collapse and if wiring is present electricity can be shorted posing a fire hazard. Prolonged wet timbers cause mould and mildew growth, can compromise structural integrity and are inviting to termites.</p>

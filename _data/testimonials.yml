- words: <p>We have employed numerous companies for assistance for our roofing problems with our roof in our current home and in our previous home. Our roof required a solution that other companies had not achieved. Since Trent worked on our roof we have not had any problems with leaks and the ongoing maintenance he recommended is always done with a minimum of fuss with the great support offered by Phoebe who kindly reminds us when the work is due. Trent is outstanding in all aspects of the job. He explains the task required in terms that all homeowners can understand and his care and professionalism is beyond reproach. Thank you TP Roofing for all of your help making our home water tight!</p>

Trent has ability to liaise well with clients and to run tiling crews efficiently. He also has an ability to source and rectify problems associated with all types of roofing projects."

- words: "I have been a property manager for over a decade and always say the tradespeople make our life and job either easy or hard…...   I have never known a roofer to come out in the rain and attend to existing issues and alleviate the problem on the spot the way Trent did yesterday, I can’t thank you enough for assisting with the situation at Laurel Street and also Chiltern Road, it allowed the tenants some relief and made our customer service A+.  In stressful times of water leaking into people’s homes it is an absolute god send to have someone who does what you do as a company, from your wonderful help when answering the phone Phoebe through to the quick quotes and Trent’s calm cool presence in times of stress, Thank you for making our job much easier we appreciate your Hard Work."

<p>Regular clearing of debris from roof, gutters and downpipes prevents blockages. Buildup of debris can cause leaks, internal water damage to the property and premature aging to the roof. Regular roof inspections and clearing of debris is an economical way to prevent expensive emergency callouts for leaks and premature roof replacements. </p>

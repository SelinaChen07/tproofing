Routine clearing of debris from roof, gutters and downpipes prevents blockages. Full gutters and valleys frequently cause roof leaks, internal water damage to the property and premature aging to the roof. Insects, birds and vermin love to live, breed and nest in roofs and gutters that are full of debris.</p>

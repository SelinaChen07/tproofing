Roof flashings are vital in protecting your home from the elements. Flashing is installed to prevent or fix roof leaks at walls, barges, gables, chimneys, skylights, vents and valleys; any roof penetrations and where any two roofing surfaces meet or where water run-off is heavy. Roof flashing directs water away from the interior of your house, preventing roof leaks, water ingress and water seepage which cause damage to your home.</p>
<p> Over time roof flashings can deteriorate or come loose. TP Roofing are experts at diagnosing the cause of roof leaks, we can identify if flashing has been incorrectly installed and will ensure the roofing material selected will be compatible with your roof as well as aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>We install Apron (cover) flashings, step flashings, chimney flashings and flashings of all roof penetrations. We install quality lead flashings and lead free flashings as well as custom made flashings from wide range of metals including stainless steel, copper, galvanised steel, Zincalume and Colorbond.</p>

TP Roofing supply and install Edmonds roof ventilators to residential homes and commercial buildings. We will assess how many roof ventilators you require, where they need to be placed to work most efficiently and what colour will best suit your roof. You will feel the difference when you install an Edmonds turbine ventilator and not in your hip pocket as they are wind driven. Windmaster whirlybirds are lightweight aluminium, suitable for metal and tiled roofs and come with a 15 year warrenty. A SupaVent can be used for homes in contact with sea spray. Heat and moisture is removed from your ceiling cavity, increasing your energy efficiency and reducing damage from condensation in your roof space.</p>

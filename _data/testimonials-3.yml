- words: <p>TP Roofing could not be more helpful. Every job is done in a prompt and professional manner. We have dealt with many roofing companies in the past who are unable to assess the problem correctly and end up over charging. Trent is always able to asses and repair first time. I would have no hesitations in recommending TP roofing to any of my clients for their roofing repairs or replacements.</p>

- words: <p>We have employed numerous companies for assistance for our roofing problems with our roof in our current home and in our previous home. Our roof required a solution that other companies had not achieved. Since Trent worked on our roof we have not had any problems with leaks and the ongoing maintenance he recommended is always done with a minimum of fuss with the great support offered by Phoebe who kindly reminds us when the work is due. Trent is outstanding in all aspects of the job. He explains the task required in terms that all homeowners can understand and his care and professionalism is beyond reproach. Thank you TP Roofing for all of your help making our home water tight!</p>

(I say so far because I know we will be looking at more roofing work in the not too distant future when we get around to the other few repairs that we have previously discussed with Trent). I would happily recommend TP Roofing to anyone, and will definitely be contacting you for any roofing jobs in the future. You and Trent have both been extremely helpful, professional, prompt, knowledgeable, and courteous.....as well as doing a great job and having very reasonable rates."

- words: "I have been a property manager for over a decade and always say the tradespeople make our life and job either easy or hard…...   I have never known a roofer to come out in the rain and attend to existing issues and alleviate the problem on the spot the way Trent did yesterday, I can’t thank you enough for assisting with the situation at Laurel Street and also Chiltern Road, it allowed the tenants some relief and made our customer service A+.  In stressful times of water leaking into people’s homes it is an absolute god send to have someone who does what you do as a company, from your wonderful help when answering the phone Phoebe through to the quick quotes and Trent’s calm cool presence in times of stress, Thank you for making our job much easier we appreciate your Hard Work."

- words: <p>TP Roofing could not be more helpful. Every job is done in a prompt and professional manner. We have dealt with many roofing companies in the past who are unable to assess the problem correctly and end up over charging. Trent is always able to asses and repair first time. I would have no hesitations in recommending TP roofing to any of my clients for their roofing repairs or replacements.</p>
